### Notions from Under the Shower Head
###### Notion: a general understanding; vague or imperfect conception or idea of something.

1. Sometimes I wish to return to a time when nearly everything was potential and so very little was realization.
1. When you fight a "fire", you fight the fire on the fire's terms. If you prevent the fire, you never fight it at all.
1. Many paths lead to the top of the mountain, some more difficult than others. The only one that matters is the one that you choose.
1. The Great is the enemy of the Good! Unfortunately, the Good is also the enemy of the Great.
1. I am not a statistic. Why does everyone continually insist on treating me like one?
1. Statistics help us understand the world around us. Statistics will not help me understand you fully.
1. Television is the opiate of the people.
1. In an event-driven 4-dimensional space-time universe, what does it mean to say that something exists?
1. Life is micro. Politics is macro.  No wonder politicians are so out of touch with the people they seek to govern.
1. Inspiration rarely comes when called. That's why it's a good idea to take notes when it does.
1. Success fades (rapidly).  Failures will follow you forever.
1. One of the consequences of unlimited opportunity is an obscured sense of direction.
1. Here's the problem with conspiracy theories: they are oh so easy to come by and nearly impossible to prove (because so little factual evidence exists to support them). 
   They exist primarily on conjecture. They make for great stories to entertain.  They should never drive everyday choices and decisions.
1. Do humans serve the rules or do the rules serve humanity?
1. Youth is largely uncertainty.  Old age is incredible frustration.
1. I'm always amazed at the number of people, who know absolutely nothing about a subject, yet are quite willing to open their mouths and pretend.
