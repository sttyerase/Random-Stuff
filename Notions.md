### Notions from Under the Shower Head
###### Notion: a general understanding; vague or imperfect conception or idea of something.

1. Sometimes I wish to return to a time when nearly everything was potential and so very little was realization.
2. We should always strive for perfection, but never expect it, especially of others.   
3. The Great is the enemy of the Good! Unfortunately, the Good is also the enemy of the Great.
4. I am not a statistic. Why does everyone continually insist on treating me like one?
5. Statistics help us understand the world around us. Simple statistics will not help me understand you fully.
6. Fifty per cent of all statistics are wrong.
7. No path to the top of the mountain is the correct path.  
   Some paths are easier than others.  The easiest path is not necessarily the best path.  
   Some paths require certain tools.  Other paths require different tools.  
   Only the path you choose matters.  
   You have not failed if you back up and start again.  
8. Television is the opiate of the people.
9. In an event-driven 4-dimensional space-time universe, what does it mean to say that something exists?
10. Life is a ceaseless upstream relay against the Second Law of Thermodynamics. What is the influence that causes it to organize and persist?
11. Life is micro. Politics is macro.  No wonder politicians are so out of touch with the people they seek to govern.
12. Inspiration rarely comes when called. That's why it's a good idea to take notes when it does.
13. Success fades (rapidly).  Failures will follow you forever.
14. One of the consequences of unlimited opportunity is an obscured sense of direction.
15. Here's the problem with conspiracy theories: they are oh so easy to come by and nearly impossible to prove (because so little factual evidence exists to support them). 
    They exist primarily on conjecture. They make for great stories to entertain.  They should never drive everyday choices and decisions.
16. Do humans serve the rules or do the rules serve humanity?
17. Youth is enormous uncertainty.  
    Old age is incredible frustration.
18. I'm always amazed at the number of people, who know absolutely nothing about a subject, yet are quite willing to open their mouths and pretend.
19. Man moves a mountain one shovel at a time.  
    One man cannot move a mountain.  
    One man must move others to move the mountain.  
    Nothing motivates like cold hard cash.
20. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of public opinion.
21. Eventually, you must chose a side, even if it's the wrong one.
22. One aspect of being human is the ability to absorb, process and live with ambiguity.
23. What happened in the past has passed.  Do we change? Do we learn? Do we grow, as a result?
24. When you fight a "fire", you fight the fire on the fire's terms. If you prevent the fire, you never fight it at all.
25. Optimist: this glass is half full.  
    Pessimist: this glass is half empty.  
    Optimistic Engineer: I'll bet we can find a way to fill this glass and keep it full.  
    Practical Engineer: This glass is way to big for the amount of water we have.
26. It's so hard to know if you are speaking truth to power, or if you are just dead wrong.
27. Making stuff happen takes effort...**lots** of effort...much more than you think it should.
28. You don't have a real thought until you can write it clearly on paper.
29. Life is a continuum uncertainty.  Living is the process of managing that uncertainty.
30. Those who can, do.  
    Those who can't, teach.  
    Those who have no clue at all enter upper management or politics.
